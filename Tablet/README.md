# PainRating Project
This is a subproject of the Zenbo Nurse Helper project. We design an Android app running on a Tablet as the user interface for patients to watch video and input their painfulness level score under the supervision of an intelligent companion robot.

# Build Instructioin
There is a file myvidoe.mp4 in the project but too large to upload to GitHub. Please download it using this script if you use cpp2/install.sh to setup our program on Ubuntu
'''sh
wget -O ~/ZenboNurseHelper/Tablet/app/src/main/res/raw/myvideo.mp4 https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/d4r3t0i7dk8cl4fxh5cjr/myvideo.mp4?rlkey=ek5xy40do3uq6hzcx77ut28mr&st=00aqom9p&dl=0
'''

Otherwise, you can manually download it from this Google Drive's [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zDzBWggeRFwNY5xkTioc5-RpIRFDgrwC/view?usp=sharing) and save it in the directory app/src/main/res/raw.
