# PainRating Project
This is a subproject of the Zenbo Nurse Helper project. We design an Android app running on a Tablet as the user interface for patients to watch video and input their painfulness level score under the supervision of an intelligent companion robot.

# Build Instructioin
There is a file myvidoe.mp4 in the project but too large to upload to GitHub. Please download it manually from this Google Drive's [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zDzBWggeRFwNY5xkTioc5-RpIRFDgrwC/view?usp=sharing) and save it in the directory app/src/main/res/raw.
